                Owner, MR. Singh, opened the restaurant in 1985, with the idea of creating a space where
                Indian food could be devoured within the respected setting it deserved: white table clothes,
                fine wine and a decor that highlights the rich cultural and artistic history of his native India.
                Having previously been a collector and dealer of Indian art and antiques, his keen eye for
                interesting pieces has made its impression on the ambiance of the restaurant, where most of the artwork
                is one of a kind (including a piece from the Indian Pavilion at Expo â€™67!).

                It is with this same passion that Mr. Singh, who can still be seen
                buzzing around the dining room on a busy night, continues to maintain
                the high quality and exceptional service to old and new clients alike.
                Over the years, Le Taj has become a staple for many Montrealers and international
                clients, with a number of patrons having grown up dining with us and coming back
                over time with families of their own. In that respect, our own family of dedicated
                staff members - many of whom have been with us since the very beginning - are in large
                part how we have built our reputation of excellence for over 30 years.
